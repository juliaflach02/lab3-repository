                The primary cause of the destruction of the Amazon Forest is deforestation brought on by mining, logging, and agriculture (particularly soy farming and cattle ranching). Large tracts of land are being cleared frequently by burning endangering biodiversity and greatly increasing carbon emissions. Deforestation is still happening at an alarming rate because of lax enforcement and political pressures despite global concern and some protective measures. As a result of this destruction millions of trees that produce oxygen and store carbon are also lost, and many animals are in danger of going extinct, as their natural habitat disappears. Native American communities suffer significant losses as well.
